# The Summit

Welcome to the Summit, a forum and micropublishing platform devoted to the discovery of actionable solutions for global challenges.

## Mission

Our mission is to crowdsource the world's minds for solving global challenges

## Global Challenges
Inspired by the [Global Issues](https://www.un.org/en/globalissues/) as presented by the United Nations, these are the most pressing global challenges that we are facing the 21st Century.

* Environmental Sustainability
* Energy Sustainability
* Food Security
* Water Security
* Natural Resource Management
* Peace and Conflict
* Human Rights
* Animal Rights
* Income Inequality
* Gender Inequality
* Racial Inequality
* Global Health
* Global Development
* Poverty
* Governance
* Education
* Technology

## Design Philosophy
The user experience is crafted based on these foundational principles:
1. The Summit is an open commons, and therefore all user-generated is freely available for public access and participation.
2. All user-generated content is subject to a member rating system in order to create natural self-moderating ecosystems.
3. Everything that the user does is seamlessly interwoven on a single page.
